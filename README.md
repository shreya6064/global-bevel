# global-bevel
A blender addon to add a synchronised and globally editable bevel to objects

Used to synchronise the final smoothing bevel across different objects in the scene. Select objects and click 'Add Global Bevel'. Bevels added in  this way are universally editable with the 'Segments' and 'Amounts' properties. 

This bevel is meant to be the final bevel added to an object for realism or for a stylised effect. The 'Viewport Visibility' button will toggle viewport visibility for all global bevels in the scene. This can be used to quickly reduce load on the scene by reducing the number of polygons being rendered in the viewport. 

I basically made this because manually turning off the final bevel added to most objects(particularly those consisting of block-like shapes) became tiresome. Leaving it on made my laptop burn. And I like to have it on just before rendering so I can see what the scene looks like with the bevel. This simplifies that process.
